Sub: Request for Registration of GDSC with Amity University Maharashtra
Hon’ble Director Sir / Hon’ble Registrar Sir,
I, the undersigned, student at Amity School of Engineering and Technology, Amity University Maharashtra, wish to bring to your kind notice that on being selected as the Google Developer Students Club (GDSC) Lead for Amity University Mumbai, I have tried to establish said club for our students.
With guidance from our faculty mentor, Dr Deepa Parasar, we have set up a core committee for the club, comprising enthusiastic and active members, abiding by guidelines provided by Google. 
We, your students, collectively seek your permission and blessings to establish our GDSC as a registered club of Amity University Mumbai.
It is a humble request that your good selves may shower your good wishes and brighten the future of our students by allowing our club GDSC AUM to be displayed as an official club on the website of Amity University Mumbai.
We not only hope, but also believe that your good selves may respond positively and as soon as conveniently possible.
Seeking your blessings,
Yours faithfully,
Tushar Sharma
For GDSC AUM
